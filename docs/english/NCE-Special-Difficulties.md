在英语中往往可以用 what 引导的感叹句来表示惊奇、愤怒、赞赏、喜悦等感情。在感叹句中主谓语采用正常语序。如课文中的例句"What a day!" 。注意以下例句：

| Instead of saying | We can say |
|--|--|
| It's a terrible day! | What a terrible day! |
| This is a beautiful picture! | What a beautiful picture! <br> What a beautiful picture this is! |

### 0203
英语中有些动词可以带两个宾语，这些动词大多具有“给予”的含义。如课文中第三行的句子“He lent me a book”中，动词 lent  后面带有表示动作结果的直接宾语（a book）和表示动作目标的间接宾语（me）。间接宾语大多数时间置于直接宾语之前，如果间接宾语在后，间接宾语前必须加“to”（表示动作对什么人而做）或“for”（表示动作为什么人而做），因此，课文中的句子也可以改写成：He lent a book to me. 注意以下例句。

| Instead of saying | We can say |
|--|--|
| He lent me a book. | He lent a book to me. |
| He sent me a card. | He sent a card to me. |
| He passed me the salt. | He passed the salt to me. |
