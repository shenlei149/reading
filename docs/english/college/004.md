A little over a year ago I began training to swim the English Channel this September. I will be 58 years old then.

My friends thought I had lost my mind; my wife didn't think I was crazy but she was somewhat worried. The question I was asked over and over again:

Why?

When a student reporter at Indiana recently asked me this question, I said, "First, let me ask you a question. What are your plans for this summer?" He replied that he was going to work in a supermarket. I didn't have to say more; he understood my point.

A challenge and something of an adventure are welcome whether you are 20 or 58, and preparing to swim the Channel is far better than working in a supermarket, especially when you have a choice.

But why did I decide to swim the Channel at 58? I myself can hardly give satisfactory answer.

The Channel has always been the greatest challenge to swimmers; a test of ability, endurance, luck, and even bravery. It is this challenge that attracts about 100 swimmers a year, who are willing to spend time, effort, and money trying it.

One fact that adds to my interest in that, if I succeed, I will be the oldest person ever to swim the Channel.
