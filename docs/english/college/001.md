1. Do not treat all new words in exactly the same way. Have you ever complained about your memory because you find it simply impossible to memorize all the new words you are learning? But, in fact, it is not your memory that is at fault. If you cram your head with too many new words at a time, some of them are bound to be crowded out. What you need to do is to deal with new words in different ways according to how frequently they occur in everyday use. While active words demand constant practice and useful words must be committed to memory, words that do not often occur in everyday situations require just a nodding acquaintance. You will find concentrating on active and useful words the most effective route to enlarging your vocabulary.

* at fault: If someone or something is **at fault**, they are to blame or are responsible for a particular situation that has gone wrong. 有过错，有责任。
* cram: to force a lot of things into a small space. 塞满。
* bound: certain or extremely likely to happen. 必定。
