Before he sailed round the world single-handed, Francis Chichester had already surprised his friends several times. He had tried to fly round the world but failed. That was in 1931.

* single-handed: 单独一人的；单独地，独自地。

The years passed. He gave up flying and began sailing. He enjoyed it greatly. Chichester was already 58 years old when he won the first solo transatlantic sailing race. His old dream of going round the world came back, but this time he would sail. His friends and doctors did not think he could do it, as he had lung cancer. But chichester was determined to carry out his plan. In August, 1966, at the age of nearly sixty-fix, an age when many men retire, he began the greatest voyage of his life. Soon, he was away in his new 16-metre boat, Gipsy Moth.

* transatlantic: 横越大西洋的。
* carry sth. out: to do or complete something, especially that you have said you would do or that you have been told to do. 执行，贯彻，实施，实现，完成。

Chichester followed the route of the great nineteenth century clipper ships. But clipper had had plenty of crew. Chichester did it all by himself, even after the main steering device had been damaged by gales. Chichester covered 14,100 miles before shopping in Sydney, Australia. This was more than twice than the distance anyone had previously sailed alone.

* clipper ship: 快速帆船，19 世纪流行的一种帆船。
* gale: a very strong wind, 大风，暴风。
