They say that blood is thicker than water, that our relatives are more important to us than others. Everyone was so kind to the old lady on her birthday. Surely hre daughter would make an even bigger effort to please her?

It was the old lady's birthday.

She got up early to be ready for the post. From the second floor flat she could see the postman when he came down the street, and the little boy from the ground floor brought up her letters on the rare occasions when anything came.

Today she was sure there would be something. Myra wouldn't forget her mother's birthday, even if she seldom wrote at other times. Of course Myra was busy. Her husband had been made Mayor, and Myra herself had got a medal for he work for the aged.

* a small metal disc, with words or a picture on it, given as a reward for a brave action, for winning a competition, or to remember a special event.

The old lady was proud of Myra, but Enid was the daughter she loved. Enid had never married, but had seemed content to live with here mother, and teach in a primary school round the comer.
