Someone said to a man, "Travel and see the world." He answered, "Why should I? People are the same everywhere. They are born. They are babies. They are children. They are adults. They grow old. They die. When they are alive, they have the same emotions. They feel love and hate, happiness and sadness, security and fear, pride and shame, comfort and discomfort. That is why I do not want to travel. I can learn everything here. I'm going to stay home."

The man was right. He was also wrong. People are the same, but people are also different. They all have the same pattern of life - birth, youth, old age, death. But these stages of life have different values in different cultures. Also, while all people have the same emotions, the causes of these emotions are different. A situation that may bring happiness in one place may not bring happiness in another place.

For example, in many countries old age is a happy time. Young people in these countries show their respect to the old people.
