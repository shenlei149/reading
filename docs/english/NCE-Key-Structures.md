### 0240 If you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!
Now study these sentences carefully:  
细读以下句子：  
在这一类条件句中，if 从句谈论想象的情况，主句则推测想象的结果。在从句中要用动词的过去时，这并不表明过去的某一特定时间或过去某一动作，因此常被称作“非真实的过去”，整个条件句也被称为非真实条件句。如果 if 从句中的动词是 be，那么应该在第一和第三人称单数名词之后用 were。
* *If you went* to the exhibition you would enjoy it.
* *If you saw* him now you wouldn't recognize him.
